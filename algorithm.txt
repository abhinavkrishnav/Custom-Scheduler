ALGORITHM FOR POD SCHEDULING IN KUBERNETES
INPUT:
PodsQueue: Queue of unscheduled pods
Nodes: Set of available nodes
PodsTypeInfo: Information about pod types and their affinities/anti-affinities
ResourceInfo: Resources available on nodes (CPU, memory, etc.)
TrafficMatrix: Matrix representing inter-pod communication traffic
LatencyMatrix: Matrix representing network latency between nodes
CostConversionFactors: Factors to convert resource usage into cost-equivalent terms (e.g., CPU cost/unit, memory cost/unit)
STEPS
1. Initialization
Compute PodsTraffic from TrafficMatrix, where PodsTraffic[i][j] represents the communication traffic between pod i and pod j.
Extract resource requirements and affinity/anti-affinity rules for each pod from PodsQueue.
2. Preprocess Nodes and Pods
Group nodes by resource capacity (e.g., high-memory, high-CPU, balanced).
Categorize pods into workload types (e.g., compute-intensive, memory-intensive, balanced).
3. Convert Resource Usage into Cost
For each node N:
Compute the cost equivalence of available resources: 
CostAvailable(N)=CPU(N)⋅CPUFactor+Memory(N)⋅MemoryFactor
Similarly, for each pod P, compute the resource request cost: 
CostRequested(P)=CPU(P)⋅CPUFactor+Memory(P)⋅MemoryFactor
4. Calculate Node Scores for Each Pod
For each pod P in PodsQueue:
For each node N in Nodes:


Compute Resource Cost Score
 ResourceCostScore(P,N)=CostAvailable(N)−CostRequested(P)
Compute Latency and Traffic Cost


For already scheduled pods Q on N: 
TrafficCost(P,Q)=PodsTraffic[P][Q]⋅LatencyMatrix[N][Node(Q)]
Sum the traffic cost: 
TrafficCostScore(P,N)=∑Q∈PodsOn(N)TrafficCost(P,Q)
Compute Final Node Score
 NodeScore(P,N)=α⋅ResourceCostScore−β⋅TrafficCostScore 
(where α,β are weight coefficients).
5. Assign Pods to Nodes
While PodsQueue is not empty:
Pop the highest-priority pod P from PodsQueue.
Sort nodes N by their NodeScore for P in descending order.
Assign P to the highest-scoring node N that satisfies all constraints:
Sufficient resources.
No anti-affinity violations.
Affinity rules are satisfied.
Update resource availability and node state.
Recompute PodsTraffic and LatencyMatrix scores for remaining pods if necessary.
7. Return Result
Output the final pod-to-node assignments.

MODIFICATIONS SUGGESTED

1. Consider pod qos class type to add separate score for pods.

2. Consider deployments with hpa and vpa .

3. In step 3, consider the actual pod level usage.
